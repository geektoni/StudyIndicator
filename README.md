#Timer Indicator

This is a small project of mine focused on creating a minimal (but useful)
Linux Unity indicator for managing studying behaviour. This is an alpha version. Feel free to send me an email if you have some suggestion/request to improve the application quality.

The application use an extra library to play a sound when a study session ends. On linux, you must open a terminal and run this command <code> sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio </code>
